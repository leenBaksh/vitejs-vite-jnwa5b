You are requires to build a Contacts App:

You need to implement following functionalities:

- List Exisiting contacts
- Add New Contact (User can pin a contact before adding it to list)
- Each Contact will be rendered either in pinned contact section if it is pinned or will show below seperator if it was not pinned

Note: Use useState hooks and JSX conditional rendering and props for passing data to child components

Good Luck
